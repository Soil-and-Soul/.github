# Soil & Soul Games

Welcome to the official repository of **Soil & Soul Games**—a creative haven where passion for gaming meets innovative design. Here, we showcase our projects, experiments, and game jam entries, all driven by our love for the art of gaming.

## About Us

Two college friends with a shared passion for creativity and gaming joined forces to build Soil & Soul Games. One partner is an engineer with a strong background in brand marketing and design, while the other brings over ten years of experience as a digital artist in the mobile gaming industry. Together, we created a space where creativity is celebrated, and every project is infused with fresh ideas and a genuine love for gaming. Our mission is simple: to craft innovative and fun experiences that delight players around the world.
